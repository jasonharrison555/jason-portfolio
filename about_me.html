                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello! I’m Jason Harrison, a passionate and
                driven individual pursuing a Bachelor of
                Science in Web Design and Development with
                a Minor in Graphic Design at Brigham Young
                University of Idaho, where I’ve maintained
                a GPA of 3.66. Throughout my academic 
                journey, I’ve developed a strong foundation
                in both the technical and creative aspects
                of web design and development. I have a 
                broad skill set in both graphic design 
                and web development, with proficiency in
                tools like Adobe XD, Illustrator, 
                Photoshop, and After Effects, as well 
                as web technologies such as HTML, CSS, 
                JavaScript, MySQL, and WordPress. I’m also
                familiar with content creation, whether it’s
                for websites, posters, or digital media, 
                and I bring strong technical and soft skills
                such as time management, critical thinking, 
                problem solving, and team collaboration. You
                can explore some of my creative projects on
                my Behance portfolio. Additionally, I’ve 
                built websites like Bountiful Foods and 
                Chamber of Commerce, which showcase my 
                development skills. I’m always eager to 
                learn new technologies and design trends 
                to stay at the cutting edge of both graphic
                design and web development, and I look forward 
                to collaborating with others on exciting projects.</p>
